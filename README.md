## üì¶ Features

- Works with profiles in both:
  - `profiles`
  - `steam_profiles/`
  - `steam_profiles(...).bak/` (all backups)
- Detects and lists available profiles
- Converts between hex folder names and readable names
- Updates the `profile_name` inside `profile.sii`
- Handles folder rename to match the new hex name

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Linux system with Steam and ETS2 installed
- `wine` installed and working
- `wget`, `xxd`, and `sed` (usually pre-installed)

To install Wine (if not already installed):

```bash
sudo pacman -S wine      # Arch
sudo apt install wine    # Debian/Ubuntu
````

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
chmod +x ETS2RenameLinux.sh
./ETS2RenameLinux.sh
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Select the profile folder to use (e.g., `steam_profiles`, `profiles`)
